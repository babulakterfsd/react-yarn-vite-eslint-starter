# This is also an starter pack for a combined package with react, vite, yarn, eslint, prettier and some other packages.

### to remove hot update in the browser console that is shown by vite itself, go to node_modules > vite > dist > client > client.mjs

###### then just remove the line 520 and return 0. if you comment it instead of remove, it will come back again later.

### things I will get here :

         1. react with vite
            2. eslint with prettier
            3. yarn
            4. react router latest version(6.6) with all routing system
            5. contextAPI setup
