# This is also an starter pack for a combined package with react, vite, yarn, eslint, prettier and some other packages.

### to remove hot update in the browser console that is shown by vite itself, go to node_modules > vite > dist > client > client.mjs

###### then just remove the line 520 and return 0. if you comment it instead of remove, it will come back again later.

### things I will get here :

         1. react with vite
            2. eslint with prettier
            3. yarn
            4. react router latest version(6.6) with all routing system
            5. contextAPI setup

#### Here I put layouts, routes and other files / folder setup as just a starter pack. Layouts / Route setup might be changed as per project demands. Like, if any any project demands using redux, I will remove contextAPI then and will use redux instead. if any project demands firebase, I will add necessary files / folders for that. I mean, this is just a starter pack. It will be changed as per project demands, but the main thing is, I will not have to do all the setup again and again. I will just have to change the files / folders following the project requirements.
